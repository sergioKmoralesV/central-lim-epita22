## Observations
1) When I plot **both the mean and the sum** from the same sample, the results in the plot are the same since it is related to the same sample.
2) I tried using different values, one of the best distributions I have are the following:
   1) **Tosses:** 1.000.000 / **Samples:** 1.000 / **Size of samples:** 5.000
   2) **Tosses:** 1.000.000 / **Samples:** 10.000 / **Size of samples:** 50.000
   3) **Tosses:** 1.000.000 / **Samples:** 50.000 / **Size of samples:** 100.000 `This takes some more time than others`
3) I also added the bell shape to the figure when we receive inputs from the user.
